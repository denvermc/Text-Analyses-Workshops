# Text Analyses Workshops & Webscraping
This is a catch-all repo for various presentations and workshop materials related to webscraping (Python & R), content analysis (dictionary-based and un/semi-supervised topic modeling), and machine learning algorithms.

## Webscraping with Python
This workshop takes participants through the process of scraping files from websites (such as downloadable PDFs) using Python and Google Chrome. While this workshop serves as an intro to the fundamentals of python coding, it is more substantively about how to use an automated web-browser (bot) to behave like a human user to download files.

This approach is very useful for participants who wish to collect their own data through databases (such as Lexis-Nexis or Hansard) without the errors and tedium of doing it manually.

## Scraping and Automated Text Analyses
### Scraping with R
This workshop takes participants through a brief tour on how to use *R* to webscrape using two different methods: API webscraping and html webscraping. The API webscraping portion will focus on how to download twitter data (including scraping individualâ€™s timelines as well as accessing broader search terms) while the html portion will download State of the Union addresses. 

### Text-As-Data Approaches to Text Analyses (Dictionary/Topic Modeling/Machine Learning)
Once we have downloaded data, we will then apply automated text analysis approaches that are both un-/semi-supervised as well as supervised. Specifically, this workshop focuses on dictionary-based sentiment analysis (using Lexicoder), estimating latent policy positions from text (using Wordfish), and training and tuning machine learning algorithms for text classification issues.
